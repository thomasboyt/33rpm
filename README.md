## Hello what is this

It's a game I'm working on called 33rpm!

## Cool is it any good

No, not really

## Oh, dang

Sorry! I hope it gets better soon. I'm working on it: https://trello.com/b/JeQa7RmL/33rpm

## Well what's it made with

[Coquette](http://coquette.maryrosecook.com/), an awesome microframework for JavaScript games, and a cavalade of build tools I don't really want to get into now.
